Find the number of Certifications held by People grouped by a Planet.

Using the BSG database described in this Quiz's description, find the number of Certifications held by People grouped by a Planet.

 

This should have two columns:

"name" will be the names of planets that have at least one certification.
"CertCount" which will be the number of certifications held by people from that planet
Order your results by planet name in ascending order.

 

Example:
If Lee is certified in "Viper" and "Mechanic" and Kara is certified in "Viper" and they are both from Caprica, then the "CertCount" for the planet Caprica should be 3.



SELECT bsgpl.name, COUNT(bsgcp.cid) AS CertCount
FROM bsg_people bsgp
INNER JOIN bsg_planets bsgpl
ON bsgp.homeworld = bsgpl.id
INNER JOIN bsg_cert_people bsgcp
ON bsgcp.pid = bsgp.id
GROUP BY bsgpl.name
ORDER BY bsgpl.name ASC;

Find people assigned to at least one instance of Viper ship class
Using the BSG database described in this Quiz's description, find the fname and lname of all people who are assigned to at least one instance of a Viper class ship (this includes all variants of Viper class ships).

 

Return only a single row per person and sort by fname in ascending order.


SELECT DISTINCT bsgp.fname, bsgp.lname 
FROM bsg_people bsgp
INNER JOIN bsg_ship_assignment bsgsa
ON bsgsa.pid = bsgp.id
INNER JOIN bsg_ship_class bsgsc
ON bsgsa.cid = bsgsc.id
WHERE bsgsc.name = "Viper"
ORDER BY bsgp.fname ASC;

Find the people who do not have Viper Certification but are still assigned to Viper class ship
Find the fname, lname, and ship_instance_id for all people who do not have Viper certification but are assigned to at least one instance of a Viper class ship (this includes all variants of Viper class ships).
 
Return a row for every ship/person combination. Order your results by fname in ascending order.
 
Use the BSG database from the Quiz Description.


SELECT bsgp.fname, bsgp.lname, bsgsi.id AS ship_instance_id
FROM bsg_people bsgp
INNER JOIN bsg_ship_assignment bsgsa 
ON bsgsa.pid = bsgp.id
INNER JOIN bsg_ship_instance bsgsi
ON bsgsa.sid = bsgsi.id
INNER JOIN bsg_ship_class bsgsc 
ON bsgsa.cid = bsgsc.id
WHERE bsgp.id NOT IN
(SELECT bsgcp.pid 
FROM bsg_cert_people bsgcp
INNER JOIN bsg_cert bsgc
ON bsgcp.cid = bsgc.id
WHERE bsgc.title="Viper"
)
AND bsgsc.name = "Viper"
ORDER BY bsgp.fname ASC;
